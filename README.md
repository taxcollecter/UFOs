# UFO Analysis

## Overview of Project:
In an effort to expose citizen compiled UFO data, we’ve been selected to assist Dana in deploying a webpage that presents this information. The data collected highlights UFO sightings from around North America between the dates of January 1st and January 13th of 2010. The webpage constructed allows users to filter the compiled data on a series of keys (Date, City, State, Country, Shape of object seen).  

## Results
-How might the webpage be used?
The webpage can be used by all who are interested in digging into reported UFO sightings. Not only are there Geographic details included within the data, but special comments for each sighting also provide additional context into each event. By filtering the data, as seen below, users are able to review and draw conclusions about the data while narrowing the scope.

## Summary
Discuss drawbacks and recommendations?
In summary, the webpage is a great tool for reviewing citizen disclosed UFO data. However, we have found a drawback and have a couple of recommendations to improve the experience. First, due to the “Text” input boxes, users can find themselves struggling to determine what keywords to filter on. Especially the shape filter. We recommend the filters be updated to dropdown inputs that are specifically driven by the underlying data in the table. This will limit users from filtering for options that do not exist within the data. Assuming dropdown inputs are not implemented, we suggest updating the filters to allow for multiple options. The process of analyzing data will be greatly improved by allowing multiple options per filter.
